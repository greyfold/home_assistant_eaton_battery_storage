# Home Assistant Eaton xStorage Home Battery Integration

A Home Assistant custom component for integrating Eaton xStorage Home battery systems.

## Credits

- Original author and maintainer: [greyfold](https://github.com/greyfold)
- Major enhancements and API documentation: [genestealer](https://github.com/genestealer)

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of battery status and energy flow
- Control charging/discharging modes
- Monitor PV production and grid consumption
- Energy saving mode configuration
- Notifications and alerts management
- Technical status monitoring

## API Documentation

This integration is based on the reverse-engineered REST API of the Eaton xStorage Home system done by @genestealer. For detailed API documentation including all endpoints, authentication, and response formats, see:

**xStorage Home REST API Unofficial Documentation:** <https://github.com/genestealer/eaton-xstorage-home-api-doc/>

## Important Accuracy Warning

> ⚠️ Inverter Power Measurement Accuracy: The built-in inverter energy monitoring has poor accuracy and typically reports power output/consumption values approximately 30% higher than actual values. Do not rely on consumption and production metrics from the inverter for accurate energy calculations. This affects all power-related sensors including grid power, load values, PV production, and consumption metrics.

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Click on "Integrations"
3. Click the three dots in the top right corner
4. Select "Custom repositories"
5. Add this repository URL.
6. Select "Integration" as the category
7. Click "Add"
8. Click "Install"
9. Restart Home Assistant

### Notifications sensor

The integration exposes a sensor named "Notifications" (entity_id typically `sensor.notifications`).

- State: the number of notifications currently returned by the inverter
- Attributes: a notifications array with entries containing `alert_id`, `level`, `type`, `sub_type`, `status`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` (plus `total`, `start`, and `size` for pagination)

Example (attributes in Home Assistant):

```yaml
notifications:
	- alert_id: 5d1b55e4-1e3b-403f-86dc-564e5b1a2191
		level: INFO
		type: DEVICES
		sub_type: BATTERY_VOLTAGE_HIGH
		status: NORMAL
		created_at: 1754724228000
		updated_at: 1754724228000
	- alert_id: 84221498-96aa-4e0c-9649-d7a4d71bf5c7
		level: CRITICAL
		type: DEVICES
		sub_type: BATTERY_VOLTAGE_HIGH
		status: READ
		created_at: 1754656076000
		updated_at: 1754692437000
total: 2
start: 0
size: 2
```

## Examples

Example Home Assistant automations are provided in the `examples/` folder:

- `examples/example_home_assistant_automation_meter_emulator.yaml` — publish real-time meter data to the inverter (MQTT) with safety limits and accuracy warning
- `examples/example_home_assistant_automation_octopus_go_intelligent_dispatching.yaml` — smart daytime charging driven by Octopus Intelligent Go dispatch windows
- `examples/example_home_assistant_automation_notifications_event.yaml` — react to new inverter alerts via EventEntity and mark notifications read

These examples use registry `device_id` and `entity_id` values for stability across renames; update them to match your setup and see inline comments for guidance.
